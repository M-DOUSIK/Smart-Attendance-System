1) Upload your code to the arduino after setting up the circuit based on the design.

2) Then open a blank excel sheet.

3) Click data streamer tab extension and connect your COM port.

4) Start collecting data and record it.

5) Once done, stop the recording and save it.

1) Entry sensor detects person.

2) Person tags their rfid.

3) Exit sensor detects person and data gets stored as entry.

4) If person forgets to tag rfid and triggers exit sensor, buzzer beeps and are forced to leave and wait for 5 seconds.

*-*

1) Exit sensor detects person.

2) Perons tags their rfid.

3) Entry sensor detects person and data gets stored as exit.

4) If person forgets to tag rfid and trigers entry sensor, buzzer beeps but person not forced to wait. If they don;t care about attendance, they will just leave and in the attendance sheet, they will have more entries than exits, which will be analyzed and found out.

5) The same data analysis can be used for other types of cheats.

[RFID reads only 1 input per entry or exit]
